# Löpül Bodon C# Coding Standarts 

Here you will see Löpül Bodon C# coding standarts used in Löpül Bodon projects.

Löpül Bodon accepts .NET framework design guidelines with few exceptions. Here, we will focus on these differences. You can refer .NET guidelines [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/).

In this document, we will talk about:
* How to name classes
* Base constructor calls
* How to name class methods and members
* Order of the class methods and members
* How to write enums

Please refer to [project wiki](https://github.com/LopulBodon/CS_CodingStandards/wiki) for the detail.
